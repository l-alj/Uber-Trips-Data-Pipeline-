# Uber-Trips-Data-Pipeline-

 I implemented an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline to process the data collected from trips taken in NYC. The infrastructure is built on Google Cloud services. Google Cloud Storage hosts and stores the raw dataset, while Mage, deployed on a Compute Engine instance, is used to process the data through the ETL pipeline, including data ingestion, transformation, and loading processes. I used BigQuery to extract relevant analytics including trip distance and duration, and built a dashboard to visualize the results.
